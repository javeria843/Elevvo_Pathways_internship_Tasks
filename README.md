**Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Product Reviews**
This project performs sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews using Naive Bayes and compares its accuracy with Logistic Regression.

**Objective**
Classify reviews as positive or negative (binary classification) by applying NLP preprocessing and machine learning models.

**Key Steps**
Data Loading – Amazon Product Reviews dataset (Kaggle or IMDb alternative).

Text Preprocessing – Lowercasing, removing stopwords, tokenization (NLTK/spaCy).

Feature Engineering – Converting text to numerical features using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer.

Model Training – Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression classifiers.

Evaluation – Compare model accuracy and classification reports.

Tools & Libraries
Pandas – Data handling

NLTK / spaCy – Text preprocessing

Scikit-learn – Vectorization, model training, evaluation

Output
Accuracy scores for both models

Confusion matrix and classification report

Insights into which model performs better for sentiment classification
